# TMPHP Framework Project

That project is the TMPHP Framework.

> Maybe is not confiable to use in production yet.

### Short history

I am a PHP developer. Then, for years I was see frameworks PHP for a lot. But, I was don't uses that others only, I was need more. I was want to go ahead.

#### the idea

When a day I was decide to initialize a long journy into knowledge. **I was decide to create a Framework from zero!**

So, I know that it's not a better way for it, _but_ I was get it.

#### experiments

I was experimented various ways to create a framework like this.

One thing that was give me proud of was has `template engine`. When I, finaly, create a `template engine` and this...

```php
@foreach($x=0; $x<10; $x++)
	// code
@endforeach
```

... finaly was possible... I was continue, and no more stop.

##### routing

An another thing that was give me proud of was `routing`. Yeah, when I finaly was get routes in a file like...

```php
Route::get('users/{slug}');
```

... and this give me a `MVC` complety... :smiley:

#### Yeah!

Something in these structure maybe has like the [laravel](https://laravel.com) structure. Yes! In fact! **BUT**, this is because `laravel` was (and is yet) the `PHP Framework` that I love so match! :hearts:

#### Isn't a copy!

Yes, look like `laravel`, but not is! The `methods`, `class` and another things look like this one, but internally is not. I developed class-by-class, method-by-method, etc.

### Future

So, in the future I want to develop more things and correct some others.
